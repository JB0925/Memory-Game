This is a memory game that was created using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
To play, you may flip over two cards at a time. If they match, the cards will stay flipped. If not, they turn back over and you may flip over two new cards. The game keeps track of your score as well. You lose twenty points for an incorrect guess, and you gain 100 points for a correct guess.
